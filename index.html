        Hi! I'm Emma, and this is my portfolio for 94-470 Telling Stories With
        Data at CMU.
      </h1>
      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        My pronouns are she/her/hers. I am a junior at Carnegie Mellon studying
        Information Systems. For those who aren't as familiar with Information
        Systems, the program involves studying the intersection of people,
        technology, and processes. I am personally very interested in this
        intersection. In the past, I've interned at Bank of America, worked with
        Mattel Creations for their product marketing strategy, and am currently
        interning as a Product Intern at TutorMe. Outside of work and school, I
        enjoy watching TV shows, reading books (I read 56 books in 2021! My
        favorites included Long Division by Kiese Laymon and Anxious People by
        Frederik Backman.), and playing Super Mario 3D World on my Switch.
      </p>
      <h2>What I Hope To Learn</h2>
      <p>
        I've always been really intrigued by data and data visualizations! One
        of my favorite publications is The New York Times's The Upshot, which
        focuses on data-centric journalism. Although I have some basic
        experience with visualizing data as I worked as a volunteer data analyst
        on two progressive political campaigns as part of the organization
        Bluebonnet Data, I hope to learn how to level up my skills by learning
        more about color theory, different types of visualization options, and
        using new software like Tableau. I love the idea of being able to tell
        full and interesting stories through data and want to get more
        comfortable working with big datasets. One of the most important skills
        that I also hope to improve on is my ability to critique data
        visualizations and identify what aspects of a visualization make it work
        versus detracting from its goal. Through Telling Stories With Data, I
        hope to accomplish these learning goals and more while working with my
        awesome group of classmates!
