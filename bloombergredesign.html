      <h1>Redesigning a Bloomberg Payroll Data Visualization</h1>
      <h2>The Original Visualization</h2>
      <p>
        The visualization I chose is from a Bloomberg article titled "'Crazy
        Mess' of Jobs Data Has Economists Getting It Wrong Again."
      </p>

      />
      <h2>Critiquing the Visualization</h2>
      <p>
        I initially evaluated my dataset with the Data Visualization
        Effectiveness Profile developed by Stephen Few, which focused on a few
        categories.
      </p>
      <h3>Usefuless: 8/10</h3>
      <p>
        I gave the visualization an 8/10 because I thought it was a very useful
        visualization for the intended audience. The subject area is the economy
        and jobs, and especially with COVID and Omicron, I think that it's
        important that people are aware of the factors affecting the U.S.
        economy. I also thought it was useful because it was pushing back
        against a narrative that jobs are really down with COVID and could
        hopefully educate people on the current state of working.
      </p>
      <h3>Completeness: 6/10</h3>
      <p>
        I gave the visualization a 6/10 because while I think it was fairly
        complete, it still was missing some key context for what payroll data
        actually is and why we should find that information important. Although
        there wasn't any missing data necessarily, I found the missing context
        important enough to dock points off for completeness because the data
        doesn't tell a full story without context.
      </p>
      <h3>Perceptibility: 6/10</h3>
      <p>
        While I thought that the visualization was okay in terms of
        perceptibility, I thought that there was unnecessary effort that would
        need to be put in to truly understand what was going on. I also thought
        that the visualizatio format wasn't making the comparison as easy and
        that greatly affected perceptibility.
      </p>
      <h3>Truthfulness: 9/10</h3>
      <p>
        I did not think that the visualization was being untruthful at all. I
        could tell that the story the visualization was trying to tell was
        supported by the data that was being visualized.
      </p>
      <h3>Intuitiveness: 6/10</h3>
      <p>
        I think that this visualization was not as intuitive for people who are
        unfamiliar with labor statistics. For example, I at first thought that
        the y-axis was in dollars since I assumed payroll ahd something to do
        with money, but it's actually people as payroll involves people that are
        being paid to work. There wasn't any guidance on how to interpret the
        data so I also thought that affected intuitiveness.
      </p>
      <h3>Aesthetics: 8/10</h3>
      <p>
        I gave this visualization a fairly high score because it's a very
        straightforward color palette and layout, and I didn't have any major
        issues in terms of the aesthetics of it affecting my interpretation of
        it. I also thought it was very on brand for Bloomberg.
      </p>
      <h3>Engagement: 7/10</h3>
      <p>
        I found it to be a fairly strong conversation starter in terms of its
        conversation about the job market, which is heavily affecting people
        right now and the possibilities that might come out of understanding how
        payroll trends are different from estimates.
      </p>
      <h2>Wireframing</h2>
      <p>
        The first thing that I immediately knew I wanted to do in terms of
        wireframing was figuring out how to represent it in a line graph instead
        of a bar chart. I thought a line graph might be better because it would
        be easier to show trends and observe the difference between the two
        measures. I also wanted to change the y-axis labeling to be on the left
        side so it would make more sense with the placement of the legend.
      </p>
      <h3>Wireframe 1</h3>
      <img src="/assets/wireframe1.PNG" alt="Wireframe 1" />
      <h3>Wireframe 2</h3>
      <img src="/assets/wireframe2.PNG" alt="@ireframe 2" />
      <h3>Wireframe 3</h3>
      <img src="/assets/wireframe3.PNG" alt="Wireframe 3" />

      <h2>Testing the Solution</h2>
      <p>
        I talked to two different people in order to test my solution and showed
        them all three wireframes to get feedback on what they liked and didn't
        like. The first person I talked to was a college student in her 20s. I
        was able to gain a few key insights from her interview.
      </p>
      <p>For things she liked:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            She thought that the line graph was effective in helping her
            understand that she was supposed to interpret the trend over time.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            She also thought the color palette being simple made the visual not
            distracting.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Of the three wireframes, she liked the format of the legend for
            Wireframe 3 the best, and also liked the more teal color scheme.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>For things she didn't like:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            She didn't like the extreme blue of Wireframes 1 and 2 because she
            thought it was a bit too bright.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            She remarked she was unfamiliar with what payroll meant and didn't
            completely understand what the numbers were representing.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>The second person I talked to was an engineer in his 30s.</p>
      <p>For things he liked:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            He liked the horizontal lines better than the vertical lines for
            being able to keep track of the payroll data.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>He also liked the line graph for seeing the trends in the data.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>For things he didn't like:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            He was also confused by the payroll data and what exactly it meant
            in terms of dollars versus jobs.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Build Your Solution</h2>
    </section>
    <p>
      I ultimately decided on a solution that included teal coloring, clearer
      labels for the title, legend, and y-axis, and the same shading in order to
      emphasize the difference between the actual values and the estimate. I
      also ended up keeping the horizontal lines instead of the vertical lines
      because that made things clearer in terms of keeping up with the trends of
      the payroll numbers.
