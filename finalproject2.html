      <h1>Final Project Part 2</h1>
      <h2>Storyboard and Wireframes</h2>
      <p>
        The first part of this is my outline including the wireframes / draft
        visualizations that I want to include for the final project as well as a
        storyboard that gives a narrative and structure to my visualizations. I
        also included some of the text and research that I wanted to put to give
        greater context for the story and the visualizations shown. This
        storyboard will serve as a precursor to my Shorthand project.

        Why You Should Care About Lawmakers Trading Stocks: The Harms of Mixing
        Money With Politics
      </h1>
      <h2>Background</h2>
      <h3>What is the stock market? How does it work?</h3>
      <p>
        First: a primer on the stock market, its importance to American politics
        and the economy, and how it works. According to James Chen of
        Investopedia, the stock market "broadly refers to the collection of
        exchanges and other venues where the buying, selling, and issuance of
        shares of publicly held companies take place." There are two leading US
        stock exchanges: the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and the NASDAQ.
        These along with the other exchanges make up the stock market, and
        people can trade on multiple exchanges. Ultimately, as Chen explains,
        "stock markets are vital components of a free-market economy because
        they enable democratized access to trading and exchange of capital for
        investors of all kinds" (Chen).
      </p>
      <p>
        One key aspect of understanding the performance of the stock market lies
        in the indicators that map its performance. Some examples of indicators
        include the DOW, NASDAQ, and S&P 500 indicators. The S&P 500 serves as a
        weighted index of the top 500 publicly listed stocks in the US and
        measures overall performance of the market (DataHub). The overall
        performance of the market has historically been shown to react to
        current events that could potentially impact the earnings of top
        companies.

      <h3>What is insider trading?</h3>
      <p>
        According to the SEC, insider trading refers to buying or selling a
        stock "while in possession of material, nonpublic information" related
        to the stock or company.
      </p>
      <h3>
        What kinds of restrictions are put on government employees? Lawmakers in
        Congress?
      </h3>
      <p>
        Most government employees do not have restrictions on trading stocks.
        However, there are some exceptions. Federal Reserve officials are banned
        from trading stocks or cryptocurrencies (Cox). For lawmakers in
        Congress, the STOCK Act passed in 2012 bans them from trading stocks on
        private information and requires disclosure of their trades within 45
        days.
      </p>

      <h3>Why should you care?</h3>
      <p>
        Public accountability and pressure can create change. The less the US
        government mixes money and politics, the more sure we can be that
        lawmakers are acting in the public's best interest.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you have the ability to vote, vote, especially for your House
        District representative. Find out a politician's stance on heavier
        regulations on trading stocks by lawmakers.

      <h1>User Research Protocol</h1>
      <p>
        This section outlines my approach to user research interviews and
        consolidating the feedback from my interviews into actionable next
        steps.
      </p>
      <h2>Target Audience For My Story</h2>
      <p>
        When I was thinking about my target audience, one of the key factors I
        was thinking about was demographic groups that are statistically less
        involved in politics than other groups. Thus, I chose young people,
        specifically people between the ages of 18 and 24. These people are
        voting age which is important for my call to action but are also part of
        the age group that has historically shown lower voter turnout
        percentages than other age groups (<a
          href="https://now.tufts.edu/news-releases/half-young-people-voted-2020-major-increase-2016"
          >Tufts</a
        >). I also in part thought that this age group would be a good choice
        because I have a lot of access to people in this age group (CMU
        students) and would be able to identify a greater variety of
        perspectives and backgrounds within my age constraints.
      </p>
      <h2>Approach to Identifying Representative Individuals</h2>
      <p>
        When it came to identifying representative individuals, I knew that I
        wanted to have a variety of individuals that fell within my age
        constraints. Specifically, I wanted to have people who had different
        levels of political literacy. I also wanted to keep in mind that my
        story is pretty US centric, and so I prioritized finding American
        citizens since I wanted to know about the efficacy of call to action
        towards people who have the ability vote. In order to assess people's
        political literacy, I asked a few questions:
      </p>
      <p>
        1. How much do you follow current events involving the US government or
        politics?
      </p>
      <p>
        2. Have you taken any government or political science classes at CMU or
        elsewhere? Which ones?
      </p>
      <p>
        3. Did you vote in the 2020 election? If you were eligible to vote
        before then, did you?
      </p>
      <p>
        From these questions I assigned each a person to either not politically
        literate, somewhat politically literate, and very politically literate.
        The individuals I identified as my interview subject were as follows:
      </p>
      <p>Individual 1: 21 year old college student</p>
      <p>- She said she follows current events daily or almost daily.</p>
      <p>- She has taken two courses at CMU about government and politics.</p>
      <p>
        - She voted in the 2020 election. That was the first year she was
        eligible to vote.
      </p>
      <p>Individual 2: 20 year old college student</p>
      <p>
        - He said he reads news articles about current events about once a week.
      </p>
      <p>
        - He has taken no courses at CMU about government and politics, but
        wants to take one eventually.
      </p>
      <p>
        - He did not vote in the 2020 election. That was the first year he was
        eligible to vote.
      </p>
      <p>Individual 3: 20 year old college student</p>
      <p>
        - She says she never follows current events. Her knowledge mostly comes
        from friends or social media platforms like Twitter.
      </p>
      <p>
        - She has not taken any courses at CMU about government and politics.
      </p>
      <p>
        - She did not vote in the 2020 election. That was the first year she was
        eligible to vote.
      </p>
      <p>
        With these 3 individuals representing different levels of political
        awareness, I felt that I would have a representative sample of the
        target audience I was aiming for.
      </p>
      <h2>Interview Script</h2>
      <p>Initial Questions and Context</p>
      <p>
        First, I will confirm the information from my previous three questions
        about their political activity. Then I will explain the purpose of my
        interview: "Today I am going to be showing you a series of data
        visualizations, and I want your feedback on my visualizations as well as
        the narrative that I'm aiming for. There are no wrong anwers, I'm just
        interested in knowing what intrigues you, what is confusing, and any
        other thoughts."
      </p>
      <p>Interview</p>
      <p>
        I will then direct them to my storyboard and wireframes and ask them to
        scroll through the text and visualizations. They can either make note of
        anything that comes up on a separate paper or can mention it to me in
        real time. In that case, I might ask follow up questions like:
      </p>
      <p>
        What aspect of this visualization do you think specifically confused
        you?
      </p>
      <p>What do you think the main takeaway of this data story is?</p>
      <p>Do you think the visualizations you saw connect to the takeaway?</p>
      <p>Why is this visualization your favorite? Your least favorite?</p>
      <p>
        I will also pick some of the visualizations and ask them to explain what
        they think the purpose of the visualization is in the best way they can.
      </p>
      <h2>Interview Findings</h2>
      <h3>
        Individual 1: 21 year old college student, very politically literate
      </h3>
      <p>
        - Based off the title, Individual 1 was already familiar with the issue
        of Congress and insider trading as it has been in the news
      </p>
      <p>
        - She mentioned that she wanted more context for the first S&P 500 graph
        and that it "maybe looks a bit cluttered with all the dates."
      </p>
      <p>
        - She liked the pie charts and that they were color coded according to
        political party as it helped make things clearer.
      </p>
      <p>
        - She found the chart about lawmakers selling off stocks a little hard
        to comprehend at first because "I skipped over the legend and couldn't
        figure out what the numbers were." She specifically mentioned the x-axis
        as being confusing at first glance because of the lack of labeling.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Individual 2: 20 year old college student, somewhat politically literate
      </h3>
      <p>
        - He said he was fairly familiar with the stock market but thought the
        beginning background section would be good for people who are
        unfamiliar.
      </p>
      <p>
        - He thought the S&P 500 graph "was kinda random" with the line
        designating the start of COVID since it wasn't mentioned anywhere else.
      </p>
      <p>
        - He mentioned a few charts that could have less labels, including the
        Total Volume chart and was confused by the STOCK Act penalties graph
        since he wasn't sure what he was supposed to take away from it.
      </p>
      <p>- He liked that the call to action was easy to understand.</p>
      <h3>
        Individual 3: 20 year old college student, not politically literate
      </h3>
      <p>
        - She thought the explanations of the stock market and S&P 500 were
        interesting but wasn't as clear on the S&P 500 graph.
      </p>
      <p>
        - She wanted more text and titles to help transition from visualization
        to visualization, and she didn't like that everything was phrased as
        questions. She said, "I'm not really seeing what I'm supposed to learn
        when everything is a question."
      </p>
      <p>
        - She thought that the Senator Burr case study visualization was easy to
        understand than the STOCK Act one since she wasn't super familiar with
        why the STOCK Act mattered in this story.
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <h2>Changes For Final Version</h2>
      <p>
        From my interview findings, I've identified the 3 main areas of
        improvement as visualization design choices, accompanying text, and
        narrative structure / transitions.
      </p>
      <p>
        For visualization design choices, there are a few visualizations that
        were brought up among the different individuals I interviewed, so I am
        prioritizing those for my changes. In particular, the S&P 500 graph
        could be simplified in terms of its labeling, as Individuals 1, 2, and 3
        mentioned that. Also, charts like Total Volume and the lawmakers selling
        off stocks came up with multiple people. I want to test if a vertical
        bar chart might be more intuitive for this purpose, or if I should just
        get rid of the x axis labels. Finally, I definitely want to tackle the
        STOCK Act penalties graph after hearing the feedback that it wasn't the
        most clear. I think that cleaning up all of the categories (and perhaps
        putting them into broader categories that will illustrate my point more
        simply) will definitely make the chart more clear.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the accompanying text, all three individuals wanted more context for
        the S&P 500 so I am prioritizing that. I also want to write a little
        more about the case study to give better context as well as the end call
        to action section. These aspects were in part because of the response I
        got from my interviews and also because seeing someone else go through
        my data story made me realize there are some key points missing when
        they were going through the case study.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, the transition aspect came up in all my interviews as well. I
        want to change some of the question headings into more definitive
        statements to help guide the reader and create a more cohesive
        narrative.
