      <h1>Final Project 2</h1>
      <h2>Storyboard and Wireframes</h2>
      <p>
        The first part of this is my outline including the wireframes / draft
        visualizations that I want to include for the final project as well as a
        storyboard that gives a narrative and structure to my visualizations. I
        also included some of the text and research that I wanted to put to give
        greater context for the story and the visualizations shown. This
        storyboard will serve as a precursor to my Shorthand project.

      <h2>Background</h2>
      <h3>What is the stock market? How does it work?</h3>
      <p>
        First: a primer on the stock market, its importance to American politics
        and the economy, and how it works. According to James Chen of
        Investopedia, the stock market "broadly refers to the collection of
        exchanges and other venues where the buying, selling, and issuance of
        shares of publicly held companies take place." There are two leading US
        stock exchanges: the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and the NASDAQ.
        These along with the other exchanges make up the stock market, and
        people can trade on multiple exchanges. Ultimately, as Chen explains,
        "stock markets are vital components of a free-market economy because
        they enable democratized access to trading and exchange of capital for
        investors of all kinds" (Chen).
      </p>
      <p>
        One key aspect of understanding the performance of the stock market lies
        in the indicators that map its performance. Some examples of indicators
        include the DOW, NASDAQ, and S&P 500 indicators. The S&P 500 serves as a
        weighted index of the top 500 publicly listed stocks in the US and
        measures overall performance of the market (DataHub). The overall
        performance of the market has historically been shown to react to
        current events that could potentially impact the earnings of top
        companies.
