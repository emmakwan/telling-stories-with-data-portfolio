      <h1>Final Project 1</h1>
      <h2>Outline</h2>
      <h3>High Level Summary</h3>
      <p>
        Much discussion has been made over Nancy Pelosi's investments and stock
        portfolio, especially in relation to how the stock market actually
        performs. I'm interested in comparing other politician's investments
        relative to market performance as a whole, and shed some light on key
        members of certain Congressional committees and their investments. For
        my initial project, I'm interested in identifying a high profile
        Democrat and Republican politican to analyze.
      </p>
      <h3>Project Structure</h3>
      <p>I envision my project structure to be as follows:</p>
      <p>Introduction to Stocks and Politician Investing</p>
      <p>
        I want to speak to some of the background on stocks, how they are bought
        and sold, and the history of politican investment as well as regulation
        into these stock investments.
      </p>
      <p>Identifying the Stock Investments of a Democratic Politician</p>
      <p>
        Then I plan on identifying the main aspects of a Democratic politician's
        portfolio, including look at ther sectors and individual stocks that
        they've invested in.

      </p>
      <p>Identifying the Stock Investments of a Republican Politician</p>
      <p>
        I also plan on identifying the main aspects of a Republican politician's
        portfolio, including look at ther sectors and individual stocks that
        they've invested in.
      </p>
      <p>

        Towards Certain Sectors
      </p>
      <p>Analyzing the Returns of Politicians</p>
      <p>
        The returns of politicians are also important to point out, including
        comparing politicians and identifying sleeper stocks that politicians
        have invested in that add to the narrative of politician's ability to be
        on top of the stock market.

      <h2>Sketches</h2>
      <p>
        For my sketches, I sketched out some of the basic visualizations that I
        plan on incorporating. I used the Democratic politican for these
        examples but I would do similar visualizations for the Republican
        politician and potentially involve more comparisons along the same
        lines. I also wanted to identify a few other aspects of my story,
        including the sleeper stocks and comparison of performance for the
        different investments.

      <h2>Data</h2>
      <p>
        The datasets I plan to use are the Capitol Trades dataset of what stocks
        politicans invest in and NASDAQ data on stock prices.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://app.capitoltrades.com/trades?page=1&pageSize=20"
          >Capitol Trades</a
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/quotes/historical"
          >NASDAQ Data</a
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        My datasets are the Capitol Trades and the NASDAQ datasets, and I plan
        on using them in order to show how the stock price changes and what
        stocks are politicans investing in. This data would allow me to show how
        these different factors interact and what aspects of stock investing are
        important to keep an eye on in terms of the implications of stock
        investing by politicans and the potential of what kind of information
        they might have.
      </p>
      <h2>Method and Medium</h2>
      <p>
        I will be using Shorthand to complete my project, as I want to be able
        to combine the visual aspects and my analysis through this platform. By
        using a combination of the visualizations that I create and specific
        headers for my analysis, I want to use Shorthand in order to organize my
        data story into a chronological story in order to showcase how the data
        develops over the course of my visualizations.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also think it's important to fully utilize Shorthand by including
        animations, transitions, and other ways for people to able to have some
        interactivity with the platform. I want to be able to incorporate those
        aspects in order to make the platform more engaging as people are
        exploring the data visualizations.
