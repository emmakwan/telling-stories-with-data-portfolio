      <h2>Reflection on Final Project</h2>
      <p>
        Going into the final iteration of the project, I had a pretty good idea
        of what kinds of changes I wanted to make based off of my user
        interviews. I spent some more time thinking about how I could appeal to
        different kinds of young voters, especially people who might not have as
        much political knowledge. I decided that I wanted to focus more on a
        simple narrative for my story in order to appeal to an audience that
        might be less interested in the nitty gritty details of every single
        trade a politician has undertaken. I also wanted to create some appeal
        to the majority by illustrating how popular of an opinion it is to want
        to further regulate Congress members trading stocks.
      </p>
      <p>
        In terms of specific changes I made, I first made changes to some of my
        visualizations. I changed the title of the S&P 500 graph so that it was
        clearer in its meaning and limited the scale of my y-axis more so that
        the trends were easier to see. For the Total Volume chart, I eliminated
        the x-axis ticks entirely because the labels on the bars of the bar
        chart were very clear and the scale didn't contribute to the meaning of
        the graph. This was part of my goal to make my charts less busy where
        possible as some of my interviewees mentioned preferring less cluttered
        visuals. I also revamped the STOCK Act chart a lot. I identified that
        the overly varied color scheme was causing visual confusion, and the
        groupings of the categories were also confusing. I simplified the color
        scheme to a gray and green color scheme to emphasize my most important
        point, which was focusing on the members that showed a proof of a fine
        after their violation. I also grouped some of the extra categories
        together because they weren't enhancing the core meaning of the chart.
        Finally, because my interviewees mentioned clearer charts and less
        busyness, I eliminated the x-axis of the Lawmakers Sell Off Stocks chart
        and kept the labels only.
      </p>
      <p>
        The other major change I made was introducing more context and
        transitions between my data visualizations. I added some key statements,
        including summarizing the impact of COVID on the market, defining
        insider trading, and introducing the case study of pre-pandemic trading
        by senators. I wanted to have clearer delineations between emphasized
        text and paragraphs in order to help with the flow of big ideas. I also
        added some more text and actionables to my call to action section,
        including adding links so people could find out who their district
        representative is and get more information on Congress member's trading
        behaviors through online trackers. This was in an effort to inspire
        action, even if it's as small as clicking a link, for my audience since
        I know they are digital natives.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ultimately, I learned a lot throughout this process. It was really
        interesting to be able to see people interacting with my visualizations
        and story in real time, and that was really helpful when I was thinking
        about the changes that I wanted to make. I felt good about making design
        and content changes in response to real people's reactions. I think when
        it comes to data and stories, it is really important to consider that
        your audience will be people and to keep their behaviors in mind.
