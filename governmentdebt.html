      <h2>OECD Government Debt-To-GDP Ratio By Country</h2>
      <p>
        This visualization shows the trend of 35 countries' Debt-To-GDP ratio
        from 1995 to 2019. According to the OECD, the Debt-To-GDP ratio is an
        indicator of a country's financial situation and sustainability. The
        changes over time seen in the Debt-To-GDP ratio are mainly a result of
        the country's deficits.

      <h2>
        Debt-To-GDP Ratio in 2010s Remains Relatively Stable for North American
        Countries
      </h2>
      <p>
        This chart compares the Debt-To-GDP ratio of the US, Mexico, and Canada
        from 2010 to 2019. A changing Debt-To-GDP ratio is a reflection of a
        country's economic sustainability according to the OECD.

        I chose a grouped bar chart because I wanted some way to be able to show
        comparisons of the Debt-To-GDP value between countries but also show
        those trends over time. After reading more about the significance of the
        Debt-To-GDP ratio and how it is important for understanding a country's
        economic stability, I found it interesting to look at regional
        comparisons and noticed that in North America, the three countries had
        relatively stable Debt-To-GDP ratios, especially in comparison to some
        other countries in the world. I was able to discern this by looking at
        the chart above, which shows the trends for 35 countries. I was also
        interested in focusing on more recent trends, so I picked the 2010s as a
        way to show a trend over the most recent full decade. Visualizing the
        changes in the Debt-To-GDP ratio shows that while the US and Canada have
        higher ratios than Mexico, they perhaps had more stable changes in their
        ratio, and the three countries as a whole remained relatively stable.

      <h2>Comparing Different Visualizations</h2>
      <p>
        For my three visualizations, I utilized three different formats: a bar
        chart, a grid of line charts, and a grouped bar chart. The three
        formats, even while using the same dataset, yield different
        interpretations and understandings of the data. The dataset is taken
        from the OECD General government debt data, and it shows the Debt-To-GDP
        ratio for a variety of countries from the years 1995 to 2019. For the
        purposes of my visualizations, I used subsets of this dataset in order
        to fit the particular visualization takeway that I was aiming for. For
        the bar chart, since the data being visualized is just from 2020, it
        helps to show the comparison for each country for that particular year.
        The usage of the highlight red color to show the US's Debt-To-GDP Ratio
        in particular helps to maintain focus on showing the US's Debt-To-GDP
        ratio relative to the other countries. On the other hand, the group of
        line charts is showing each country's individual trend line for their
        Debt-To-GDP ratio, which helps to give us a sense of change over time.
        The change over time through the line graph for each country provides a
        different interpretation of comparing countries. Because of the nature
        of the number of individual countries shown and the line graph, it's a
        bit harder to interpret specific numbers and easier to interpret more of
        the overarching changes. For the third graph, which is a grouped bar
        chart, I wanted to strike a balance between comparing between countries
        and showing trends over time. I narrowed down my data to just focus on
        the US, Mexico, and Canada in the 2010s because it provided a clearer
        story and visualization. The grouped bar charts for each year allow for
        a direct comparison of the countries for each year, but the presence of
        multiple years allows for observing the trends over time. The grouped
        bar chart is different from a regular bar chart because it is able to
        show trends over time and comparisons.
