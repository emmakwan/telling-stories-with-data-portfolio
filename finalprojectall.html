      <h1>Final Project All Parts</h1>
      <h1>Part 1</h1>
      <h2>Outline</h2>
      <h3>High Level Summary</h3>
      <p>
        Much discussion has been made over Nancy Pelosi's investments and stock
        portfolio, especially in relation to how the stock market actually
        performs. I'm interested in comparing other politician's investments
        relative to market performance as a whole, and shed some light on key
        members of certain Congressional committees and their investments. For
        my initial project, I'm interested in identifying a high profile
        Democrat and Republican politican to analyze.
      </p>
      <h3>Project Structure</h3>
      <p>I envision my project structure to be as follows:</p>
      <p>Introduction to Stocks and Politician Investing</p>
      <p>
        I want to speak to some of the background on stocks, how they are bought
        and sold, and the history of politican investment as well as regulation
        into these stock investments.
      </p>
      <p>Identifying the Stock Investments of a Democratic Politician</p>
      <p>
        Then I plan on identifying the main aspects of a Democratic politician's
        portfolio, including look at ther sectors and individual stocks that
        they've invested in.
      </p>
      <p>

        Towards Certain Sectors
      </p>
      <p>Identifying the Stock Investments of a Republican Politician</p>
      <p>
        I also plan on identifying the main aspects of a Republican politician's
        portfolio, including look at ther sectors and individual stocks that
        they've invested in.
      </p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>
        Visualization: Republican Politician's Portfolio Has Shifted More
        Towards Certain Sectors
      </p>
      <p>Analyzing the Returns of Politicians</p>
      <p>
        The returns of politicians are also important to point out, including
        comparing politicians and identifying sleeper stocks that politicians
        have invested in that add to the narrative of politician's ability to be
        on top of the stock market.
      </p>
      <p>Visualization: Democractic vs. Republican Stock Returns</p>
      <p>Visualization: Sleeper Stocks that Politicans Have Identified</p>

      <h2>Sketches</h2>
      <p>
        For my sketches, I sketched out some of the basic visualizations that I
        plan on incorporating. I used the Democratic politican for these
        examples but I would do similar visualizations for the Republican
        politician and potentially involve more comparisons along the same
        lines. I also wanted to identify a few other aspects of my story,
        including the sleeper stocks and comparison of performance for the
        different investments.

      <h2>Data</h2>
      <p>
        The datasets I plan to use are the Capitol Trades dataset of what stocks
        politicans invest in and NASDAQ data on stock prices.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://app.capitoltrades.com/trades?page=1&pageSize=20"
          >Capitol Trades</a
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/quotes/historical"
          >NASDAQ Data</a
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        My datasets are the Capitol Trades and the NASDAQ datasets, and I plan
        on using them in order to show how the stock price changes and what
        stocks are politicans investing in. This data would allow me to show how
        these different factors interact and what aspects of stock investing are
        important to keep an eye on in terms of the implications of stock
        investing by politicans and the potential of what kind of information
        they might have.
      </p>
      <h2>Method and Medium</h2>
      <p>
        I will be using Shorthand to complete my project, as I want to be able
        to combine the visual aspects and my analysis through this platform. By
        using a combination of the visualizations that I create and specific
        headers for my analysis, I want to use Shorthand in order to organize my
        data story into a chronological story in order to showcase how the data
        develops over the course of my visualizations.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also think it's important to fully utilize Shorthand by including
        animations, transitions, and other ways for people to able to have some
        interactivity with the platform. I want to be able to incorporate those
        aspects in order to make the platform more engaging as people are
        exploring the data visualizations.

      <h1>Part 2</h1>
      <h2>Storyboard and Wireframes</h2>
      <p>
        The first part of this is my outline including the wireframes / draft
        visualizations that I want to include for the final project as well as a
        storyboard that gives a narrative and structure to my visualizations. I
        also included some of the text and research that I wanted to put to give
        greater context for the story and the visualizations shown. This
        storyboard will serve as a precursor to my Shorthand project.

        Why You Should Care About Lawmakers Trading Stocks: The Harms of Mixing
        Money With Politics
      </h1>
      <h2>Background</h2>
      <h3>What is the stock market? How does it work?</h3>
      <p>
        First: a primer on the stock market, its importance to American politics
        and the economy, and how it works. According to James Chen of
        Investopedia, the stock market "broadly refers to the collection of
        exchanges and other venues where the buying, selling, and issuance of
        shares of publicly held companies take place." There are two leading US
        stock exchanges: the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and the NASDAQ.
        These along with the other exchanges make up the stock market, and
        people can trade on multiple exchanges. Ultimately, as Chen explains,
        "stock markets are vital components of a free-market economy because
        they enable democratized access to trading and exchange of capital for
        investors of all kinds" (Chen).
      </p>
      <p>
        One key aspect of understanding the performance of the stock market lies
        in the indicators that map its performance. Some examples of indicators
        include the DOW, NASDAQ, and S&P 500 indicators. The S&P 500 serves as a
        weighted index of the top 500 publicly listed stocks in the US and
        measures overall performance of the market (DataHub). The overall
        performance of the market has historically been shown to react to
        current events that could potentially impact the earnings of top
        companies.

      <h3>What is insider trading?</h3>
      <p>
        According to the SEC, insider trading refers to buying or selling a
        stock "while in possession of material, nonpublic information" related
        to the stock or company.
      </p>
      <h3>
        What kinds of restrictions are put on government employees? Lawmakers in
        Congress?
      </h3>
      <p>
        Most government employees do not have restrictions on trading stocks.
        However, there are some exceptions. Federal Reserve officials are banned
        from trading stocks or cryptocurrencies (Cox). For lawmakers in
        Congress, the STOCK Act passed in 2012 bans them from trading stocks on
        private information and requires disclosure of their trades within 45
        days.
      </p>

        they trading?

      <h3>Why should you care?</h3>
      <p>
        Public accountability and pressure can create change. The less the US
        government mixes money and politics, the more sure we can be that
        lawmakers are acting in the public's best interest.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you have the ability to vote, vote, especially for your House
        District representative. Find out a politician's stance on heavier
        regulations on trading stocks by lawmakers.

      <h1>User Research Protocol</h1>
      <p>
        This section outlines my approach to user research interviews and
        consolidating the feedback from my interviews into actionable next
        steps.
      </p>
      <h2>Target Audience For My Story</h2>
      <p>
        When I was thinking about my target audience, one of the key factors I
        was thinking about was demographic groups that are statistically less
        involved in politics than other groups. Thus, I chose young people,
        specifically people between the ages of 18 and 24. These people are
        voting age which is important for my call to action but are also part of
        the age group that has historically shown lower voter turnout
        percentages than other age groups (<a
          href="https://now.tufts.edu/news-releases/half-young-people-voted-2020-major-increase-2016"
          >Tufts</a
        >). I also in part thought that this age group would be a good choice
        because I have a lot of access to people in this age group (CMU
        students) and would be able to identify a greater variety of
        perspectives and backgrounds within my age constraints.
      </p>
      <h2>Approach to Identifying Representative Individuals</h2>
      <p>
        When it came to identifying representative individuals, I knew that I
        wanted to have a variety of individuals that fell within my age
        constraints. Specifically, I wanted to have people who had different
        levels of political literacy. I also wanted to keep in mind that my
        story is pretty US centric, and so I prioritized finding American
        citizens since I wanted to know about the efficacy of call to action
        towards people who have the ability vote. In order to assess people's
        political literacy, I asked a few questions:
      </p>
      <p>
        1. How much do you follow current events involving the US government or
        politics?
      </p>
      <p>
        2. Have you taken any government or political science classes at CMU or
        elsewhere? Which ones?
      </p>
      <p>
        3. Did you vote in the 2020 election? If you were eligible to vote
        before then, did you?
      </p>
      <p>
        From these questions I assigned each a person to either not politically
        literate, somewhat politically literate, and very politically literate.
        The individuals I identified as my interview subject were as follows:
      </p>
      <p>Individual 1: 21 year old college student</p>
      <p>- She said she follows current events daily or almost daily.</p>
      <p>- She has taken two courses at CMU about government and politics.</p>
      <p>
        - She voted in the 2020 election. That was the first year she was
        eligible to vote.
      </p>
      <p>Individual 2: 20 year old college student</p>
      <p>
        - He said he reads news articles about current events about once a week.
      </p>
      <p>
        - He has taken no courses at CMU about government and politics, but
        wants to take one eventually.
      </p>
      <p>
        - He did not vote in the 2020 election. That was the first year he was
        eligible to vote.
      </p>
      <p>Individual 3: 20 year old college student</p>
      <p>
        - She says she never follows current events. Her knowledge mostly comes
        from friends or social media platforms like Twitter.
      </p>
      <p>
        - She has not taken any courses at CMU about government and politics.
      </p>
      <p>
        - She did not vote in the 2020 election. That was the first year she was
        eligible to vote.
      </p>
      <p>
        With these 3 individuals representing different levels of political
        awareness, I felt that I would have a representative sample of the
        target audience I was aiming for.
      </p>
      <h2>Interview Script</h2>
      <p>Initial Questions and Context</p>
      <p>
        First, I will confirm the information from my previous three questions
        about their political activity. Then I will explain the purpose of my
        interview: "Today I am going to be showing you a series of data
        visualizations, and I want your feedback on my visualizations as well as
        the narrative that I'm aiming for. There are no wrong anwers, I'm just
        interested in knowing what intrigues you, what is confusing, and any
        other thoughts."
      </p>
      <p>Interview</p>
      <p>
        I will then direct them to my storyboard and wireframes and ask them to
        scroll through the text and visualizations. They can either make note of
        anything that comes up on a separate paper or can mention it to me in
        real time. In that case, I might ask follow up questions like:
      </p>
      <p>
        What aspect of this visualization do you think specifically confused
        you?
      </p>
      <p>What do you think the main takeaway of this data story is?</p>
      <p>Do you think the visualizations you saw connect to the takeaway?</p>
      <p>Why is this visualization your favorite? Your least favorite?</p>
      <p>
        I will also pick some of the visualizations and ask them to explain what
        they think the purpose of the visualization is in the best way they can.
      </p>
      <h2>Interview Findings</h2>
      <h3>
        Individual 1: 21 year old college student, very politically literate
      </h3>
      <p>
        - Based off the title, Individual 1 was already familiar with the issue
        of Congress and insider trading as it has been in the news
      </p>
      <p>
        - She mentioned that she wanted more context for the first S&P 500 graph
        and that it "maybe looks a bit cluttered with all the dates."
      </p>
      <p>
        - She liked the pie charts and that they were color coded according to
        political party as it helped make things clearer.
      </p>
      <p>
        - She found the chart about lawmakers selling off stocks a little hard
        to comprehend at first because "I skipped over the legend and couldn't
        figure out what the numbers were." She specifically mentioned the x-axis
        as being confusing at first glance because of the lack of labeling.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Individual 2: 20 year old college student, somewhat politically literate
      </h3>
      <p>
        - He said he was fairly familiar with the stock market but thought the
        beginning background section would be good for people who are
        unfamiliar.
      </p>
      <p>
        - He thought the S&P 500 graph "was kinda random" with the line
        designating the start of COVID since it wasn't mentioned anywhere else.
      </p>
      <p>
        - He mentioned a few charts that could have less labels, including the
        Total Volume chart and was confused by the STOCK Act penalties graph
        since he wasn't sure what he was supposed to take away from it.
      </p>
      <p>- He liked that the call to action was easy to understand.</p>
      <h3>
        Individual 3: 20 year old college student, not politically literate
      </h3>
      <p>
        - She thought the explanations of the stock market and S&P 500 were
        interesting but wasn't as clear on the S&P 500 graph.
      </p>
      <p>
        - She wanted more text and titles to help transition from visualization
        to visualization, and she didn't like that everything was phrased as
        questions. She said, "I'm not really seeing what I'm supposed to learn
        when everything is a question."
      </p>
      <p>
        - She thought that the Senator Burr case study visualization was easy to
        understand than the STOCK Act one since she wasn't super familiar with
        why the STOCK Act mattered in this story.

      <h2>Changes For Final Version</h2>
      <p>
        From my interview findings, I've identified the 3 main areas of
        improvement as visualization design choices, accompanying text, and
        narrative structure / transitions.
      </p>
      <p>
        For visualization design choices, there are a few visualizations that
        were brought up among the different individuals I interviewed, so I am
        prioritizing those for my changes. In particular, the S&P 500 graph
        could be simplified in terms of its labeling, as Individuals 1, 2, and 3
        mentioned that. Also, charts like Total Volume and the lawmakers selling
        off stocks came up with multiple people. I want to test if a vertical
        bar chart might be more intuitive for this purpose, or if I should just
        get rid of the x axis labels. Finally, I definitely want to tackle the
        STOCK Act penalties graph after hearing the feedback that it wasn't the
        most clear. I think that cleaning up all of the categories (and perhaps
        putting them into broader categories that will illustrate my point more
        simply) will definitely make the chart more clear.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the accompanying text, all three individuals wanted more context for
        the S&P 500 so I am prioritizing that. I also want to write a little
        more about the case study to give better context as well as the end call
        to action section. These aspects were in part because of the response I
        got from my interviews and also because seeing someone else go through
        my data story made me realize there are some key points missing when
        they were going through the case study.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, the transition aspect came up in all my interviews as well. I
        want to change some of the question headings into more definitive
        statements to help guide the reader and create a more cohesive
        narrative.

      <h2>Reflection on Final Project</h2>
      <p>
        Going into the final iteration of the project, I had a pretty good idea
        of what kinds of changes I wanted to make based off of my user
        interviews. I spent some more time thinking about how I could appeal to
        different kinds of young voters, especially people who might not have as
        much political knowledge. I decided that I wanted to focus more on a
        simple narrative for my story in order to appeal to an audience that
        might be less interested in the nitty gritty details of every single
        trade a politician has undertaken. I also wanted to create some appeal
        to the majority by illustrating how popular of an opinion it is to want
        to further regulate Congress members trading stocks.
      </p>
      <p>
        In terms of specific changes I made, I first made changes to some of my
        visualizations. I changed the title of the S&P 500 graph so that it was
        clearer in its meaning and limited the scale of my y-axis more so that
        the trends were easier to see. For the Total Volume chart, I eliminated
        the x-axis ticks entirely because the labels on the bars of the bar
        chart were very clear and the scale didn't contribute to the meaning of
        the graph. This was part of my goal to make my charts less busy where
        possible as some of my interviewees mentioned preferring less cluttered
        visuals. I also revamped the STOCK Act chart a lot. I identified that
        the overly varied color scheme was causing visual confusion, and the
        groupings of the categories were also confusing. I simplified the color
        scheme to a gray and green color scheme to emphasize my most important
        point, which was focusing on the members that showed a proof of a fine
        after their violation. I also grouped some of the extra categories
        together because they weren't enhancing the core meaning of the chart.
        Finally, because my interviewees mentioned clearer charts and less
        busyness, I eliminated the x-axis of the Lawmakers Sell Off Stocks chart
        and kept the labels only.
      </p>
      <p>
        The other major change I made was introducing more context and
        transitions between my data visualizations. I added some key statements,
        including summarizing the impact of COVID on the market, defining
        insider trading, and introducing the case study of pre-pandemic trading
        by senators. I wanted to have clearer delineations between emphasized
        text and paragraphs in order to help with the flow of big ideas. I also
        added some more text and actionables to my call to action section,
        including adding links so people could find out who their district
        representative is and get more information on Congress member's trading
        behaviors through online trackers. This was in an effort to inspire
        action, even if it's as small as clicking a link, for my audience since
        I know they are digital natives.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ultimately, I learned a lot throughout this process. It was really
        interesting to be able to see people interacting with my visualizations
        and story in real time, and that was really helpful when I was thinking
        about the changes that I wanted to make. I felt good about making design
        and content changes in response to real people's reactions. I think when
        it comes to data and stories, it is really important to consider that
        your audience will be people and to keep their behaviors in mind.
